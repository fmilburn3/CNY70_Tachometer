# CNY70_Tachometer
Demonstration of Addicore CNY70 Reflective Sensor being used as a tachometer.  While written for Energia it has instructions on how to modify it for the Arduino Uno.  See the wiki for photographs of the build.

Ideas for further development:
1) Try using a transistor to amplify and better differentiate the output / turn it into a binary output
2) Try using two of them as an encoder
